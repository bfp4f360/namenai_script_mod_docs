Hello this is a simple mkdocs site for the NSM (Namenai Script Mod).

## Features

As of now theres only one feature, the jumppack. I plan to add other scripts like "energy shields" on uniforms/vest and vehicles and a generic afterburner script for jets/helicopters/vehicles. However these take time so big sad.


### Jumppack
There are 2 jumppacks. The XD-1 and XD-1 LTU. The difference is that the XD-1 LTU stands for "Limited Time Use" meaning you can only jump a select few times. This is because it has no energy regen. The onyl way to get energy back is to enter arsenal, ACE or BIS. If you do things like backpack on chest you will lose all energy, basicly anything where it spawns a new backpack. You can drop the backpack on the floor and it will retain its energy.

You can use CBA keybinds, just go to `Options > Controls > Configure Addons > NSM Jumppack Mod`. Of the 3, you only need to bind `jump` and one of `cycle left` or `cycle right`. The cycle buttons are like a weapon wheel in older games.

The way the jumppack works is, you select a jumptype (with `cycle left` or `cycle right`), and press `jump`. Thats fucking hard ye? You can even configure a jumptype to be directional, as in it jumps u in the direction you are looking. So if you look stright up it will jump you stright up, if you look down you will jump down. Non directional jumps follow a path independent of where you are looking, just in the direction you are facing.

You can do the following to have our own jumppack.

## Future

As I mentioned I plan to

1. Add a generic afterburner for jets/helis/vehicles
2. Energy shield for vehicles and players. Like Halo or some other bullshit sci fi shit ðŸ’©.
