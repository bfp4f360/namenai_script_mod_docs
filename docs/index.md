Hello this is a simple mkdocs site for the NSM (Namenai Script Mod).

## Features

As of now theres only one feature, the jumppack. I plan to add other scripts like "energy shields" on uniforms/vest and vehicles and a generic afterburner script for jets/helicopters/vehicles. However these take time so big sad.


### Jumppack

I suspect that alot of ppl outside will like the jumppack, you can do the following to have our own jumppack.

!!! info "Inheritance for own jumppack"	
    #### Example config.cpp	
    ```cpp	
    class CfgPatches	
    {	
        class my_cool_jumppack_patch	
        {	
            author="UR NAME HERE";	
            requiredAddons[]=	
            {	
                "NSM_patch_end"
            };	
            requiredVersion=0.1;	
            units[]={	
            };	
            weapons[]={};	
            vehicles[]={	
                "UR_COOL_NEW_JUMPPACK"	
            };	
        };	
    };	
    class CfgVehicles	
    {	
        class NSM_neutral_XD_1_backpack;	
        class UR_COOL_NEW_JUMPPACK: NSM_neutral_XD_1_backpack
        {
            scope = 2;

            // wowe daz me ðŸ˜Š
            author = "NSM";
            displayname = "[Jumppack] XD-1"; //Name this to whatever you want
            NSM_jumppack_is_jumppack = 1; // 1 means yes, 0 means no.

            // In seconds, I would not reccomend making 
            // this less then 1 just to account for user lag/network lag.
            NSM_jumppack_spam_delay = 1;

            // How much energy the pack has, think of like fuel.
            NSM_jumppack_energy_capacity = 200; 
            NSM_jumppack_recharge = 5; // How much energy per second is regenerated.

            
            // This is a little bit ugly
            // I wish there was a JSON/Dictonary
            // config way do doing this, but the 
            // cloest is hashmaps from CBA
            // but thats a script thing not
            // config, RIP cpp :)
            NSM_jumppack_jump_types[] = {
                {
                    "Forward Jump",// Name of jump
                    {
                        12,		//forward velo(0)
                        20,		//verticle velo(1)
                        50,		//cost(2)
                        0,		//angle(3)
                        0,		//directional(4)(no=0,yes=1)?
                        0		//can prone jump(5)(no=0,yes=1)?
                    }
                },
                {"Short Jump",{25,7,20,0,1,1}}
            };

            // I wouldnt reccomend changing these below.
            // Mainly because...idk. I just think its a little
            // bit complicated the way I set it up.
            // I will try to make it easier in future
            // to add stuff, mainly particle effects
            NSM_jumppack_jump_effect_script = "NSM_jumppack_effect_fnc_jt_21";
            NSM_jumppack_effect_points[] = {{"spine3",{0,-0.3,-0.1}}}; 
            NSM_jumppack_sound_ignite[] = {"NSM_Main\sounds\cdv21Start.ogg"};
            NSM_jumppack_sound_land[] = {"NSM_Main\sounds\cdv21End.ogg"};
            NSM_jumppack_sound_idle[] = {"NSM_Main\sounds\cdv21Idle.ogg"};

            //Obviously do watever u want here
            model = "NSM_Objects\Data\XD_1_Jumppack.p3d";
            maximumload = 100;
            hiddenSelections[] = {"camo1"};
            hiddenSelectionsTextures[] = {"NSM_Objects\Data\XD_1_JumpPack_CO.paa"};
            picture = "\NSM_Objects\icon.paa";
        };
    };	
    ```

## Future

As I mentioned I plan to

1. Add a generic afterburner for jets/helis/vehicles
2. Energy shield for vehicles and players. Like Halo or some other bullshit sci fi shit ðŸ’©.
